# MAZE-TERMIND
## Thrilled to share my experience from the RMI Robotics Workshop, MAZE-TERMIND.

During this immersive workshop, our team – Brain of Tomorrow (BoT) – successfully designed and built a maze-solving robot while exploring a wide array of topics, including:

    Arduino programming for robotic movement control

    Servo motor integration for maze navigation

    Fundamentals of inverse kinematics for motion planning

    Introduction to image processing using OpenCV for robotics

    Breadboarding and assembling circuits using basic electronics

    Fine-tuning motion through real-time testing and experimentation

This workshop was a perfect fusion of hardware prototyping and software development, where we witnessed how electronics, mechanical systems, and programming seamlessly come together to address real-world challenges.

I am sincerely grateful to the RMI team and mentors for their expert guidance, making this a truly hands-on and insightful learning journey.

I look forward to applying these skills to future projects in robotics and computer vision.

Thank you, NIT Trichy, for providing this platform and for fostering a culture of innovation.
